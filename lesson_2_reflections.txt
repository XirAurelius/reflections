What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the metadata folder which it will record all of my commit changes and information in. This is needed so that it can store that data.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory because it contains only files being tracked that have changes that will be caught up in the next commit. This is valuable because it allows us to limit commits to logically related changes, as well as see quickly before committing what files this logical change currently affects.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can add only files to the staging area that contain parts that comprise the single logical change and then commit them as a group. If any files are accidentally added that do not belong, reviewing the staging area with git diff --staged and removing those unrelated files before commit can prevent unrelated changes from ending up in the commit.
