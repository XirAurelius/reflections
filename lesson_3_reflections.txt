When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to collaborate with others on a project. When I want to be able to work on a project from multiple computers, such as my home desktop and my laptop. Also to back up my repository to safeguard it against loss.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If a bug was introduced with the most recent change I might not want to pull immediately. Also if I'm working on a feature that will go into a new branch that I will create when I am ready to commit I might not want my changes destroyed out from under my by Git when it auto syncs with the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to create a copy of a remote repository where you don't want the changes you make to be reflected in the original source repository.
Clones are used to create a copy of a remote repository so that you can work on and submit changes that are intended to be present in the remote repository.
Branches are used to create a parallel development stream so that new features or changes can be worked on that won't be represented in other branches until they are merged by the developer.
