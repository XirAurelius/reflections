When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to collaborate with others on a project. When I want to be able to work on a project from multiple computers, such as my home desktop and my laptop. Also to back up my repository to safeguard it against loss.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If a bug was introduced with the most recent change I might not want to pull immediately. Also if I'm working on a feature that will go into a new branch that I will create when I am ready to commit I might not want my changes destroyed out from under my by Git when it auto syncs with the remote repository.
